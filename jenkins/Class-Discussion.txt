DevOps Key Areas:
-----------------

1.) CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery/Deployment)
2.) Infrastructure Automation – Terraform, Ansible
3.) Cloud Administration – AWS, Azure, GCP
4.) Containers & Kubernetes
5.) Monitoring & Logging
6.) Automation with Python / Bash / PowerShell
7.) System Administration – Linux & Windows


Role Overlaps

Cloud Engineer / Platform Engineer / DevOps Engineer / SRE (Site Reliability Engineer)

Above mentioned skill sets are Overlapping in all of these roles.

Docker vs. Kubernetes:
----------------------

First, let us recap, What are Containers?

    Containers are lightweight, portable units of software that package:
    - Application code
    - Dependencies & libraries
    - Runtime environment

    They ensure the app runs consistently across environments (dev, test, prod).

    Key advantages:
    - Isolation (like lightweight VMs, but share the host OS kernel).
    - Faster startup & smaller footprint than VMs.
    - Easy to replicate, scale, and deploy.

Now, let us understand Docker:
    
    A containerization platform that helps build, package, and run containers.

    Core concepts:
    - Dockerfile -> Blueprint to build an image.
    - Image -> Immutable snapshot (app + dependencies).
    - Container -> Running instance of an image.

What is Kubernetes (K8s) and why it is required?

    A container orchestration platform (created by Google, 2014)

    Solves problems when running containers at scale:
    - Deploy containers across multiple servers/VMs.
    - Run multiple replicas for load balancing.
    - Ensure self-healing & high availability.
    - Provide networking & service discovery.

    It becomes essential once teams move from "running a few Docker containers" -> to "managing hundreds or thousands in production".


Continuous Integration (CI)
----------------------------

Definition: CI focuses on automating the build, test, scan, and package stages of application development.

Typical CI Pipeline:

1.) Code Checkout stage
    - Developer commits code -> pipeline triggers in Jenkins/GitHub Actions/GitLab CI using their webhook based triggers
    - OR Jenkins/GitHub Actions/GitLab CI monitor / Polls the Git repo and branches and detect new commits and triggers the pipelines

2.) Build / Install dependencies stage
    - For Java: mvn build / install
    - For NodeJs: npm install / build
    - For Python: pip install -r requirements.txt

3.) Test
    - For Python: pytest
    - For Java: mvn test

4.) Package
    - For Java: mvn package
    - For Other languages create artifacts (e.g., .jar, .zip, .tar).

5.) Scan
    - Static Code Analysis (SonarQube)
    - Vulnerability Scanning (Trivy)
    - Code Coverage

6.) Push
    - Artifact Repositories: Nexus, JFrog Artifactory
    - Container Registries: DockerHub, ECR, ACR

Note: These are just references, actual command will / may vary as per the project requirements

Continuous Delivery / Deployment (CD)
-------------------------------------

Continuous Delivery: A software engineering practice where code changes prepared for release after the CI phase requires a manual trigger for deployment to ensure controlled rollout

Continuous Deployment: An extension of CD where every code change that passes the CI phase is automatically deployed without human intervention, enabling rapid and frequent releases

Jenkins:
--------

- A widely used CI/CD tool that executes pipelines.
- Can also run ad-hoc automation and scripts.


Poll SCM vs. Webhooks:
----------------------

Poll SCM -> Jenkins checks GitHub periodically (e.g., every 5 min) for new commits.

Webhook -> GitHub instantly notifies Jenkins on new commits (preferred approach).

-----

Jenkins Real World Work Items:

1.) Jenkins Controller and Agent setup

2.) Plugin installations


3.) Taking regular backups
How to backup and restore Jenkins Controller / Master

BackUp Steps:
- Take the backup of /var/lib/jenkins folder

Restore Steps:
- Install Jenkins
- Replace the content of /var/lib/jenkins from the backup
- Restart Jenkins: systemctl restart jenkins

4.) Creating Freestyle jobs for general Automation

5.) Creating Pipelines for CI/CD 
    - Integrate the pipeline with the webhook
    - The pipeline are attached with a Agent
    - No secrets should be in plain text in the Pipeline
    - Make use of the environment variables

6.) Managing and Running the pipelines
    - Issues w.r.t Agent not running: Check the Agent logs, fix the issue and restart
    - Pipeline failures: Check each and every line in the Console Output, find the issue, resolve the issue and re-run

----

We setup workflows in the CI/CD pipelines
-----------------------------------------

What are workflows?
Step-by-step automated actions that take code -> transform -> deploy -> validate.

Gather these requirements before developing the Jenkins Jobs:

Typically ask these questions:

    CI Flow:

    1.) Which Repos to Clone
    2.) How to Install Dependencies / Build the Code (If Required)
    3.) How to Run Unit Tests
    4.) How to do Code Quality Check (If Required)
    5.) How to Package the Code
    6.) Push to Artifact Repo / Registry (DevOps team / Engineer can suggest here)


    CD Flow (DevOps Team / Engineer can suggest this entire flow):

    Traditional Server:
    1.) SSH into servers
    2.) Go to the folder
    3.) Download package -> extract -> replace old code
    4.) Restart service:

    Kubernetes:
    1.) Update image in manifest file
    2.) Apply latest deployment


    Regression / Automation Suite:
    1.) Keep regression in a separate Jenkins job
    2.) The regression suite should trigger only when there is a commit in "integration" branch


How many Jenkinsfile should I have?

    -- There is no defined / standard answer to it
    -- Minimize the number of Jenkinsfiles in repo.
    -- Typical pattern:
        Jenkinsfile.ci -> Build, Test, Package, Push artifact.
        Jenkinsfile.cd -> Deploy to environment (with parameter: dev/qa/uat/prod).
    -- Repo Structure Considerations:
        Microservice repo (1 service) -> 1 CI + 1–2 CD pipelines.
        Monolith repo (10+ modules) -> multiple CI pipelines + multiple CD pipelines

How do I finalize that what is an optimized way to create a Jenkinsfile/s for my product / project?

-- Always 1st brainstorm on the expected outcome
    - On each dev commit, I should be able to build/ install/ run tests on it
    - On all the commit on my "xyz" branch or all the merges to my "xyz" branch, build/ install/ run tests and deploy the code in "dev" env
    - Once everything is merged on "qa" branch, run the regression test after deploying my codebase to qa env
    - Once  everything is merged on "master" branch, deploy on production env
