I have to deploy an ecommerce site in AWS

-> IAM Policies and Roles
-> VPC - route table - subnets (private and public)
-> Multiple EC2s with EBS
-> Auto-scaling groups
-> S3
-> Load Balancer
-> AWS RDS (Database)
-> CloudWatch (Monitoring)

- First there should be a Dev env for dev team wherein they continuous deploy and test their changes

-> First time, we do everything manually and make sure to capture each and every step and capture the screenshot as well, thus create a runbook or playbook

-> Identify the chunks which can be automated via script

- 2nd for QA Team there should a QA team

- 3rd Staging / UAT for pre-prod changes

- Finally the production env

-----------

Windows - Batch

This was / is by far the easiest way to code without knowing how to write in complex languages....

you can simply state the configuration which you desire...

I can state:

Create VPC - with its cidr range....
