Session 1:

I have to deploy an ecommerce site in AWS

-> IAM Policies and Roles
-> VPC - route table - subnets (private and public)
-> Multiple EC2s with EBS
-> Auto-scaling groups
-> S3
-> Load Balancer
-> AWS RDS (Database)
-> CloudWatch (Monitoring)

Environment Provisioning Strategy without Infrastructure as code:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

You must deploy this e-commerce platform across multiple environments:

1.) First the deployment is fully manual to learn all required steps in the "Dev" environments
- Capture every configuration step and screenshot -> build a Runbook / Playbook.
- Identify which tasks can later be automated using scripts.

2.) Then the deployment is promoted to the QA Environment
- Again manually using the same runbook as created above

and then to further environments

These steps are entirely manual and requires careful execution and may have inconsistencies.

Environment Provisioning Strategy with simple Automation:
---------------------------------------------------------

Some chunks of small repeatable tasks are identified and then automated via writing shell or batch / powershell scripts

Issues With Only Using Scripts (Shell/Batch/PowerShell):

- No State Awareness: Scripts don't know what already exists which leads to duplicate resources, failures, and drift.

- Not Idempotent: Running the same script twice can break things.

- No Environment Consistency: Dev, QA, Staging, Prod become slightly different over time.

- No Plan or Preview: Scripts run blindly as there is no option of dry-run.

- Poor Dependency Handling: Scripts require manual ordering, no implicit dependency management.

- Hard to Scale & Maintain: As infra grows, scripts become large, complex, error-prone.

Introducing Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
-----------------------------------------

IaC allows you to define your infrastructure in a declarative format, enabling:

- Repeatability
- Version-controlled infrastructure
- Automated deployments
- Zero manual drift
- Multi-environment consistency

Popular IAC tools:

AWS -> CloudFormation
Azure -> ARM template, Biceps
OpenSource -> Terraform, Pulumi (Requires extensive programming capability)

Why Terraform?
--------------

- It is vendor-agnostic (works with AWS, Azure, GCP, VMware, Kubernetes, etc.).
- Uses HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) - simple, declarative, human-readable.
- Large open-source community contributing modules and best practices.
- Easy to learn because you describe the infrastructure instead of writing complex logic.

Terraform is currently the industry’s most widely adopted IaC tool for provisioning cloud infrastructure.
