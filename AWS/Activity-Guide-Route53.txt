Create a Public Hosted Zone in Route 53 + A and CNAME Records
-------------------------------------------------------------

Objective: Create a production-ready Public Hosted Zone, add A Records (IPv4) and CNAME Records, understand their purpose, and test DNS resolution.

Prerequisites:
- A registered domain name (bought from Route 53 or any external registrar)
- IAM user/role with permissions: AmazonRoute53FullAccess

Steps:

1.) Create a Public Hosted Zone

Console Navigation:
Route 53 -> Hosted Zones -> Create Hosted Zone

Configuration:
Domain Name: yourdomain.com
Type: Public Hosted Zone
VPC Association: Not required for public zones

What this step means:
- A Public Hosted Zone is used for domains that must be resolvable on the public internet.
- AWS automatically creates NS and SOA records.
- NS (Name Server) records tell the world which Route 53 servers host your domain.
- SOA (Start of Authority) defines DNS metadata (TTL, refresh time, etc.).

Important Step After Creation:
- If your domain is NOT purchased in AWS Route 53 (e.g., GoDaddy), update the domain's NS records at the registrar -> set to Route 53's NS values.
- Without this, DNS will not work globally.

2.) Create an A Record (IPv4)

Scenario:
Point your domain yourdomain.com -> to a web server or Load Balancer.

Console Navigation:
Inside the Hosted Zone -> Create Record
Configuration:
Record Name:
(blank) -> for root domain yourdomain.com
Record Type: A – IPv4 address
Value: (Choose one)
Public EC2 IP -> 13.x.x.x
or
ALB DNS name -> Select "Alias to Application Load Balancer"
Routing Policy: Simple (default)
Record TTL: 300 seconds (default)

- What this step means:
An A record maps a domain name -> IPv4 address.
If you choose Alias, AWS automatically tracks the target's IP (ALB, CloudFront, S3 website).

Example outcomes:
yourdomain.com -> Public EC2 / ALB


3.) Create a CNAME Record

Scenario:
You want:
www.yourdomain.com -> points to yourdomain.com

Console Navigation:
Hosted Zone -> Create Record

Configuration:
Record Name: www (this creates www.yourdomain.com)
Type: CNAME
Value: yourdomain.com

TTL: 300 seconds

- What this step means:
CNAME maps one domain -> another domain.
It cannot point to an IP directly (that's A record).

4.) Test Your Records

Methods to verify DNS:

- Using Local Machine (Windows/Linux/macOS)
nslookup yourdomain.com
nslookup www.yourdomain.com

- Using dig (Linux/macOS/CloudShell)
dig yourdomain.com
dig www.yourdomain.com
