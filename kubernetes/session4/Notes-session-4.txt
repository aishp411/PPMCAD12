Understanding the Kubernetes Ingress:
-------------------------------------

How do you expose service externally?
- There are 2 ways to do it:
	- LoadBalancer service - which will create a Load Balancer in Cloud
	- NodePort service - Not preferred for prod use cases

If I am running an Ecommerce website in Kubernetes:
	- It has following microservices:
		- Admin - External - LoadBalancer
		- Frontend - External - LoadBalancer
		- Backend - Internal - ClusterIP
		- Database - Internal - ClusterIP

We will end up with 2 Load Balancers in AWS..

The LBs are the external endpoint which receive the request from end users..

After receiving the request forward the request to multiple Services

Problem of having multiple Load Balancers:

- Management: Troubleshooting is tough, configurations, multiple listener rules, multiple target groups, multiple SSL certificates
- Cost: un-necessarily we are paying for multiple Load Balancers when the need should have been fulfilled with 1.
- Resource utilization which will lead to more cost..

So the need of an ideal way was thought upon:

if a user is accessing https://shopnow.com

The request flow should be:

user (browser) (https://shopnow.com) -> DNS (route53) -> it will find a record for shopnow.com -> 1 Load Balancer -> multiple services running in Kubernetes
					--------
				Ingress Controller + Ingress 

I write certain rules:

1.) Whenever the request comes to / or "" meaning https://shopnow.com/ or https://shopnow.com

then the request should go to Frontend service

2.) Whenever the request comes to /admin meaning https://shopnow.com/admin

then the request should go to admin service

-------------------------------------------------

Ingress = Ingress Controller + Ingress Object 


Pre-requisite: An Ingress controller is responsible for fulfilling the Ingress, usually with a load balancer. Only creating an Ingress resource has no effect without an Ingress Controller.

Request Flow:
Browser (User / Client) -> flipkart.com -> DNS name gets resolved -> route53 -> LoadBalancer (Internet Facing)
-> EKS Cluster (Ingress Controllers) -> Ingress Resource / File -> Based on the Ingress file the request is sent to the specific service -> pod

Some popular controllers include:

a.) Ingress-Nginx (Open-Source) Controller for Kubernetes using NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer for any Kubernetes Cluster

b.) AWS Load Balancer Controller to manage Application Load Balancers for EKS

c.) AKS Application Gateway Ingress Controller that configures the Azure Application 
Gateway for AKS

d.) Nginx-Ingress (Enterprise managed by Nginx company)


Ingress is an API object in Kubernetes that manages external access to services within a cluster. It acts as a layer 7 load balancer, providing features like SSL termination, name-based virtual hosting, and path-based routing.

Key features:
- Distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend services.
- Can handle HTTPS traffic by managing certificates.
- Routes requests to different services based on the request hostname.
- Directs requests to different services based on the URL path.
- Allows configuration of routing rules in one place.


handson for Ingress Nginx Controller:
-------------------------------------

- Deploy the Ingress Nginx Controller.
    - Steps to install Ingress Nginx Controller:
    Ingress-Nginx-Controller\Installation-Guide.txt
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.12.3/deploy/static/provider/aws/deploy.yaml
    
- Once this is installed, copy the AWS Network Load Balancer DNS for future reference, using the command:
	- kubectl get services -n ingress-nginx // if installed correctly then it will print the AWS NLB DNS in the external IP
	
- Analyze the sample app in: 
	- manifests\sample-app-for-ingress-nginx.yaml
	
- This file has all the kubernetes objects required for running 2 application / micro-services on kubernetes

- This file also have an ingress object defined which is pointing to nginx ingress controller using following declaration:
	- ingressClassName: nginx
	
- Deploy this file
	- kubectl apply -f manifests\sample-app-for-ingress-nginx.yaml
	
- Verify the application using the NLB DNS copied earlier
	- http://<nlb-dns>/app1
	- http://<nlb-dns>/app2
